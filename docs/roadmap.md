# spine's Roadmap

Or, more like a list of issues and features I may address at some point :)

## Changing state of a book

- What: Users should be able to change a book from "want" to "read"
- Why: Basic feature to be taken seriously
- How: Need to match correct book...by exact title? by internal ID? Fuzzy matches with selection?

## Get book info

- What: Users can add books by title or ISBN but spline should fill in the rest of the data.
- Why: Only storing data that users enter will be of limited use, users will expect to see author and other metadata.
- How: Via a suitable API? Mandatory or optional? User supplies key? Select from list of matches?

## Local storage

- What: Persistent storage of users' books.
- Why: Data needs to be stored somewhere!
- How: Flat file? CSV? Option to export from one to other?
