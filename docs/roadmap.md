# spine's Roadmap

Or, more like a list of issues and features I may address at some point :)

## v0.4
- More robust metadata handling via custom types for title/author/isbn
- Open handles missing fields, inserting defaults
- Library file can be at any user-provided path, with several defaults checked
- Get user input for selection when multiple hits

## Beyond
- More metadata: date read, publisher, translator, edition, comment etc.
- Metadata can be added/edited (title, author, isbn)
- Implement custom Error(s)
- Import/export from/to format compatible with Hardcover/Goodreads/Storygraph
- Leverage an API service (which?) to `validate` books - adding/correcting data
- Utilise Hardcover.app API in other ways (TBD)
- TUI using ratatui
